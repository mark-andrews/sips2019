# Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec ornare vestibulum
libero, nec sagittis odio placerat eget. Integer a varius orci. Aenean posuere
fringilla tortor, eu sodales massa lacinia vel. Vivamus augue arcu, semper id
scelerisque vel, condimentum ac justo. Fusce dictum rhoncus enim ornare
fermentum. Donec venenatis aliquam semper. Mauris facilisis placerat dolor vitae
ultricies. Aliquam id dui nec eros consectetur rhoncus eu at ante. Integer erat

maximus vulputate neque at lacinia.

```{r random_numbers, include=FALSE}
N <- 100
x <- rnorm(N)
mean(x)
```

We have `r N` random numbers. Their mean is `r round(mean(x), 2)`. Their median is `r round(median(x), 2)`. Their standard deviation is `r round(sd(x), 2)`.

```{r load_packages}
library(dplyr)
```

## Some basics of Markdown

We make something emphasized like *this*, and bold like *this*, or both like ***this***. We can do sub~scripts~ and super^scripts^ (but there are other ways too). You can indicate that something is code as follows^[If you this on a Unix based system, you'll delete your entire hard drive. You have been warned]: `sudo rm -rf /`. You can have code in blocks too as follows:
```
from foobar import barfoo
x = barfoo.foo()
```
The code just shown is Python. RMarkdown, or rather `knitr` with package called `reticulate`, can actually parse Python. We'll leave that aside for now, but we can easily get RMarkdown to syntax highlight our code.
```python
class Foobar(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.x = 42
```
We can do this with R too:
```r
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 15)
```
or 
```{r r_syntax_highlighting, echo=T, eval=F}
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 15)
```

<!-- Comments in the text are like this. -->
```{r, include=F}
# comments in code are like this
```

<!-- Put in a page break. If you must. 
\newpage is similar, but

\pagebreak

![A cute monkey](include/monkey.jpg)

```{r, echo=F, include_image, fig.cap="The same cute monkey"}
knitr::include_graphics('include/monkey.jpg')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Two monkeys side by side.",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('include/monkey.jpg', 'include/monkey.jpg'))

# Lists

We can do unordered lists like this:

* A thing
* Another thing
  * A thing on sublist
  * Another thing on the sublist
* Another other thing
* And so on
* And on

We can enumerated list like this:

1. The first thing
1. The second thing
    1. The first thing on sublist
    1. The second thing on the sublist
1. The third thing
1. And so on
1. And on

And mixes of the two:

We can enumerated list like this:

1. The first thing
1. The second thing
    * Another thing
    * Yet another
1. The third thing
1. And so on
1. And on

Another type of list is a *definition* list.

A monkey

: A very cute blue animal.

A cat

: A handsome creature with whiskers and claws.

An owl

: A bird type thing, but very wise.

# Math(s)

In RMarkdown, especially when we use `pdf_document`, we can use the full power of the \TeX/\LaTeX\ typesetting languages, which were designed for mathematical and technical content. There is a lot to learn, but it is worth it.

For inline \LaTeX, use single `$` surrounding the code. For example, `$\alpha$` gives us $\alpha$, or `$e^\pi$` gives us $e^\pi$ or `\omega + \xi + \theta = \chi^2` gives us $\omega + \xi + \theta = \chi^2$. For so called *display* math, you use `$$`. For example,
```
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i
```
gives us
$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

## Some more examples.

This one uses `\sim` and `quad` and `\text`.

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i\quad \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\quad\text{for $i \in 1\ldots n$}.
$$

Here's the use of `\sum`, `\prod`, `\log`, and `\left(`...`\right)`.

$$
\sum_{i=0} \log{x_i} = \log\left(\prod_i x_i\right)
$$

This one uses `\lim` and `\frac`, and other things.

$$
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
$$

# Include R generated graphics

Include your plotting code in an R chunk, and that will work.
```{r scatterplot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)
) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(se = F)

```

It is better to `fig.cap`, `fig.align`, `out.width` and other statements in the chunk definition.
```{r scatterplot_2, out.width='0.5\\textwidth', fig.cap='A scatterplot and line of best fit.', fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)
) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(se = F)

```
Now we can say things like: As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:scatterplot_2}, we have a scatterplot.

```{r cowplot_setup}
library(cowplot)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = disp, y = mpg)
) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(se = F)

p2 <- ggplot(mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = wt, y = hp)
) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(se = F)
```

```{r cowplot_1, fig.cap='A cowplot', fig.align='center', out.width='0.5\\textwidth'}
# Side by side
plot_grid(p1, p2, labels=c('a', 'b'))
```

```{r cowplot_2, fig.cap='Another cowplot', fig.align='center', out.width='0.5\\textwidth'}
# On top of each other
plot_grid(p1, p2, labels=c('a', 'b'), nrow = 2, align = "v")
```
